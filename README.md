Hello, I’m @goro53467. Call me Goro. 
I'm interested in learning to code, specifically data science, machine learning, Swift and possibly some web design. 
Outside of code, a major interest of mine is Japanese history and culture (esp modern business practices, Kurosawa, Hokusai, Teito Monogatari).
I'm also interested in Western history and culture generally. And I draw, paint, carve, sculpt and make masks, props and other things. 
Plus I have a recent diagnosis of adult ADHD. 
I'm learning to live with a properly functioning brain for the first time, so a lot of what I am doing is playing 'catch up'!
